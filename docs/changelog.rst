Origins
=======

This project started when I was writing my PhD thesis and needed a realtime simulator for a balancing mono-wheel robot. The simulator not only had to be fast but also deliver high fidelity results. After investigating commercial solutions I have reached the conculsion that I need to implement my own tool becasue simulation times were prohibitively long and no direct interaction with the robot was possible. I decided to use Bullet Physics library and build a simulator capable of computing multi-body dynamics with an analytic tyre-ground collision model, in realitime.
Thanks to this simulator I was able to implement my whole control system in a virtual environment and simulate the robot in an interactive way, which allowed me to finish my PhD thesis.

During my PhD studies I had a brief adventure with underwater robotics and after I finished my PhD I started working in this field. 
Being mostly interested in control design, I have realised that a modern simulator for underwater robots is missing. That is how I started exteding *Stonefish* with marine robotics features and regularily using it in my research. 
I saw that this work can be of benefit for the whole marine robotics community and decided to release it as open-source software.
